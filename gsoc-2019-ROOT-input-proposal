Hi all, I'm a master student at the University of Padova doing my last year on Telecommunications Engineering. I've been working on my master thesis on LST images analysis with CNNs for event reconstruction. So far I've used the DL1_ML1 machine learning dataset in HDF5 file format available in the CTA internal wiki and then it would be really nice working on this project to enable CTLearn natively loading data from currently working IACTs!
